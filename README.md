## Customer Detail Analysis

### Features

- Track customer-level KPIs: revenue, profit, order value, and repeat behavior
- Segment customers by value tiers (Low, Medium, High) and purchase behavior (One-Time vs. Repeat)
- Analyze churn and repeat rate trends over time
- Identify top customers and their order behaviors
- Visualize cumulative customer growth over the fiscal period

### Insights
- Majority of customers are low-value and one-time buyers. Repeat buyers tend to spend more per purchase. Focus on converting them to repeat buyers with loyalty programs or personalized offers
- Revenue per customer is relatively high ($2,945), but gross profit per customer is low ($329.69), meaning margins are thin (11.19%) which imply high cost of goods sold (COGS)
- Monthly unique customers hover around 1.5–2.2k, with a cumulative total of about 20k by June—suggesting retention is steady
- Cumulative Customers consistently increased, indicating steady acquisition
- Total Customers show some fluctuation, possibly due to churn and seasonal changes
